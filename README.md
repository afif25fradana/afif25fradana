# Hi, I'm Afif 👋

![EndeavourOS](https://img.shields.io/badge/platform-EndeavourOS-blueviolet)

## About Me

- 📚 Uni student, just exploring tech & Linux in my spare time
- 🐧 Daily driver: EndeavourOS (KDE + Hyprland), but dual-boot with Windows 11 for convenience
- 🎮 Casual gamer (mostly PC, RPGs & strategy)
- 🤓 Anime/manga fan (but not *that* deep)
- 🛠️ Not a Linux expert, just enjoy tweaking configs and backups for my own use

## What I Do

- Make config backups so I don't lose my shit after a reinstall!
- Try out different desktop environments and window managers
- Adapt configs from cool projects (like Hyde Project for Hyprland)
- Share screenshots and notes for future reference

- **OS:** EndeavourOS (Arch-based), Windows 11

## Repo Highlights

- [Personal-dual-de-endeavouros](https://github.com/afif25fradana/Personal-dual-de-endeavouros):  
  Config dumps for KDE Plasma & Hyprland. Mostly for my own backup, but maybe useful for others.  
  ⚠️ Mostly adapted from [Hyde Project](https://github.com/Hyde-project/hyde)—not much personal customization yet.
