## 👨‍💻 About Me

- 🎓 Uni student (Accounting) with a growing love for tech, Linux, and ricing
- 🐧 Daily driver: EndeavourOS (KDE + Hyprland), dual-booted with Windows 11
- 🎮 PC gamer — into story-driven, adventure, and racing titles
- 🌸 Anime & manga enjoyer (casual tier)
- 🛠️ Not a Linux pro — I just like messing with configs and learning from trial & error

## ⚙️ What I Do

- Backup configs so I don't fucking rage after a system wipe 🧼
- Test out different DEs & WMs — from comfy KDE to snappy Hyprland
- Adapt cool open-source setups (e.g., Hyde Project)
- Share screenshots, notes, and maybe inspire fellow tinkerers

## 🔥 Repo Highlights

- [`Personal-dual-de-endeavouros`](https://github.com/afif25fradana/Personal-dual-de-endeavouros)  
  ➤ Config dumps for **KDE Plasma** and **Hyprland**  
  ⚠️ Based on [Hyde Project](https://github.com/Hyde-project/hyde) — still minimal personal tweaks
